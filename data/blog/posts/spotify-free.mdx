## How do I get Spotify Premium for free on Windows?

Got you homie. Just **install this browser extension**: [Blockify](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/spotify-ad-blocker-blocki/nfmlkliedggdodlbgghmmchhgckjoaml)

This will skip all the ads as long as you use Spotify on the browser. Thus giving you Spotify Premium for free!

## Spotify Premium using the app

Download Spotify for your platform: https://www.spotify.com/de-en/download/other/

Follow this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/14rszaw/v3_the_ultimate_spotify_ad_blocking_guide_windows/

or just install this: https://github.com/SpotX-Official/SpotX

## Listen along without Spotify Premium

Install BetterDiscord: https://betterdiscord.app/

Download this plugin: https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/SpotifyListenAlong

Open Discord, go to settings, find the BetterDiscord tab > Plugins > Open Plugins Folder

Drop the `.js` file you download there.

Restart Discord and Spotify, test it out. Enjoy!
