If you tried to run:
`npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id "PROJECT_ID" --schema public > types/supabase.ts`
and you got this error:
`failed to retrieve generated types: {"message":"Your account does not have the necessary privileges to access this endpoint. For more details, refer to our documentation https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/access-control"}
Try rerunning the command with --debug to troubleshoot the error.`

Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/
Select your project
In the URL you can find https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
Copy that project id and use it in the command

I mistakenly used the organization id instead of the project id.
