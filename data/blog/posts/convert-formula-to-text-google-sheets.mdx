Edit > Find and Replace
or (Ctrl + H)

Select "Also search within formulas"

Search `=` and replace with a ` ` empty space

This should convert any formulas in your selected range in simple text, removing the `=` at the beginning of the cell.

If you have another `=` somewhere in your text, better use regex. "Search using regular expressions" explore that option from the "Find and replace" popup.
