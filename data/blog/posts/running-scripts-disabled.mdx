## The error

`yarn : File C:\Program Files\nodejs\yarn.ps1 cannot be 
loaded because running scripts is disabled on this 
system. For more information, see 
about_Execution_Policies at 
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.`

## The fix

Open PowerShell as Administrator and input this:
`Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`

Another solution is to set the command prompt as your default terminal in your IDE.

In VS Code:

Open the terminal, click the downward arrow near the + sign and click _Select Default Profile_ from the menu that pops up.
