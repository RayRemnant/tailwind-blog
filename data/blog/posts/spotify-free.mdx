## How do I get Spotify Premium for free on the browser?

Got you homie. Just **install this browser extension**: [Blockify](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/spotify-ad-blocker-blocki/nfmlkliedggdodlbgghmmchhgckjoaml)

This will skip all the ads as long as you use Spotify on the browser. Thus giving you Spotify Premium for free!

## Spotify Premium using the app (Windows or Mac)

Download Spotify for your platform: https://www.spotify.com/de-en/download/other/

### Option 1

Follow this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/14rszaw/v3_the_ultimate_spotify_ad_blocking_guide_windows/

or just install this: https://github.com/SpotX-Official/SpotX


### Option 2

Install Spicetify: https://spicetify.app/docs/getting-started (if the following commands don't work, check the docs)

For Windows:

`iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli/master/install.ps1 | iex`

and then:

`iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spicetify/spicetify-marketplace/main/resources/install.ps1 | iex`

Opening Spotify you should now see a "Marketplace" entry on the top left.

Open it and using the search box on the top right type: "adblockify"

Install it.

Restart Spotify, test it out. Enjoy!

## Listen along without Spotify Premium

Install BetterDiscord: https://betterdiscord.app/

Download this plugin: https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/SpotifyListenAlong

Open Discord, go to settings, find the BetterDiscord tab > Plugins > Open Plugins Folder

Drop the `.js` file you download there.

Restart Discord and Spotify, test it out. Enjoy!

## 0PluginLibrary.plugin.js error

If you are getting an error on the ZeresPluginLibrary (which is required for SpotifyListenAlong to function) follow these steps:

Open Discord, go to settings, find the BetterDiscord tab > Plugins > Open Plugins Folder

Open the `0PluginLibrary.plugin.js` file in a text editor, VS Code is good too.

Replace line 3843 toÂ `const Swatch = ColorPickerComponents?.CustomColorButton?.prototype?.render?.call({props: {}})?.type;`
If you are using VS Code navigating to it is pretty easy:
1. Press **Ctrl + G** and type "3843"
2. Replace the line with the string mentioned above

UPDATE: should be fixed in the latest version.
