Having trouble setting the timezone in Windows?
This will help you set it through the Command Prompt.

Use `tzutil /s <DESIRED TIMEZONE STRING>`

You can get the list of timezones with the command `tzutil /l`

So for example `tzutil /s Central European Standard Time` will set the timezone to UTC+01:00

To get the current timezone type `tzutil /g`
