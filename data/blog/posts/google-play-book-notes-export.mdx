So you are using Google Play Books as your main reading app, and now you want to save your precious notes in a more flexible format. Great, me too!

First things first...

**Make sure you have enabled the option**:

1. Open Google Play Books
2. Tap on your profile on the up right
3. Open "Play Books settings"
4. Make sure "Save notes, highlights and bookmarks in Google Drive"

## How to use

Open the Google Drive where your notes are saved and download them.
There should be a list of `.docx` files. Download them and use this for converting them to JSON (or HTML): https://github.com/RayRemnant/play-book-notes-to-json

There's basic instructions, but if you need any help feel free to reach out!
