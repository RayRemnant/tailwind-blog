First of all, in the upper menu bar go to Extensions -> Apps Script

add this function (you can safely delete whatever was there if you've never opened Apps Script before):

```
function GETLINK(input){
	return SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet().getRange(input).getRichTextValue().getLinkUrl();
}
```

Back to your sheet, in a new column write `=GETLINK(B2)`, replace `B2` with the column you want to extract the hyperlink from and the row it starts at.

There will be an error, but don't worry, it's necessary for the drag option to work and set the rest of the cells as `B3`, `B4`, etc.

Once you've filled all the necessary cells, **select your column** and press `CTRL + H`

The **Find and replace** window should open up, if not, go to `Edit > Find and replace` (should be the last option).

Inside the **Find** input field, paste `\(([A-Z][0-9]+)\)`.

Inside the **Replace with** input field, paste `("$1")`.

Select **Search using regular expressions** and **Also search within formulas**.

This will effectively replace every `B2`, `B3` inside your formula with `"B2"`, `"B3"`, making the custom formula `GETLINK` work.

The new created column should be filled with the desired links.

## How to copy the links somewhere else (without the formula)

Now, you probably want to copy the links somewhere else and avoid using the formula for them to show up.

To do this, **select the the newly populated column**, **go to a new empty column** and **Right Click > Paste Special > Values Only**.

This new column will have the **links as text with no hyperlink associated with them**.

To fix this, **back to Apps Script** create a new file `convertToHyperlinksCtrlKStyle` and paste this code:

```
function convertToHyperlinksCtrlKStyle() {
var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();
var sourceRange = sheet.getRange('B2:B'); // Source column where URLs are stored
var targetColumn = 2; // Column number for the target column (B is 2, C is 3, etc.)
var values = sourceRange.getValues();

for (var i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
var cellValue = values[i][0];
if (cellValue && isValidURL(cellValue)) {
var targetCell = sheet.getRange(i + 2, targetColumn); // Adjust row and column
targetCell.setValue(cellValue); // Set the plain URL as the text in the target cell
}
}
}

// Optional function to validate if the text is a URL
function isValidURL(url) {
var regex = /(http|https):\/\/[^\s$.?#].[^\s]\*/;
return regex.test(url);
}
```

Edit your column `B2:B`, the source of the text links, and the target column `2` which is the same as `B` in this case.

After that, **click the Run button** on the upper menu.

Done! You should see the changes on your sheet.

Remember that this will work on your currently active sheet.
